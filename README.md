近期看到新闻全球骚乱 打砸抢时间频发  感觉在电脑前工作久了四肢有些退化 遇到这种事情时会吃亏 随即决定锻炼下身体练下拳 为了让练习更有趣一些 用arduino制作的一个拳击游戏机 功能有：
1会记录每一拳的力量大小转化为分数 并用led灯带显示出来  （满分100）
2会记录每一拳的反应速度 并转化为分数 （满分100）
3游戏每一局十拳 会有总分统计 

玩法：
1按开始按钮 
2屏幕显示hello
3喇叭响一声后开始 听到响声后用最大的力量和最快的反应速度击打靶子
4击打后led灯带会根据你的击打力量大小显示不同的长度

This is what MT doesn't understand. You can ask me a question
A boxing game made by ARDUINO is still good. Old fellow welcomes you.
Recently, I saw the news, the global riots, the frequent smashing and looting time, and I felt that after working in front of the computer for a long time, my limbs would suffer when I encountered this kind of thing, so I decided to exercise my body to practice boxing in order to make the practice more interesting. Some functions of a boxing game machine made by Arduino are as follows:
1 will record the strength of each punch and convert it into score and display it with LED light strip (full score of 100)
2 will record the reaction speed of each punch and convert it to score (full score 100)
3. There will be a total score of ten punches in each game
Play method:
1 press the start button
2 screen display hello
3. Hit the target with the maximum force and the fastest response speed after the horn rings
4. After striking, the LED light belt will display different lengths according to your striking force
5 after hitting, the screen will display four groups of data separated by "-" which are "total strength score", "total reaction speed score", "this strength score" and "this reaction speed score"
6. Hit again after the horn rings (ten groups in total)
7. After ten groups of practice, the horn will ring for three seconds
